* A CSS3 layout mode that provides an easy way to arrange items within a container
    - No floats!!!!
    - Responsive and mobile friendly
    - positioning child elements is much easier
    - flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents
    - order of elements can easily be changed without editing the source HTML

## the box model
* assign widths and use floats to arrange items on the page

## cons
* Working with padding and margin and doing lots of simple math can be tedious and error prone
